# tiddlywiki-directory-listing
Scans a linux directory, subdirectories &amp; files, and creates a tiddlywiki. Each folder &amp; file becomes a hyperlinked tiddler. Makes it easy to browse and search a file system, and share the listings with others. The size of each file in MB is also included in the fileSize field for any file tiddlers.
